# Job-Scraper
Python script that scrapes common job boards and returns specific jobs to an SQL database

This project uses Python's module MySQL and the database software to store Job Posting data from multiple popular websites. The script searches the html of popular job board sites with specifc keyword terms and return the first page postings of each site to database.
The purpose for this project was to have majority of top postings in a centralized location that can be easily viewable and to make sure the applicant(myself) had all available postings known to them.
